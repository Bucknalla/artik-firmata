Balena Fin Firmata Implementation for Artik 020 (Co-processor)

What is the Firmata Protocol?
-----------------------------

> Firmata is a protocol for communicating with microcontrollers from software on a computer (or smartphone/tablet, etc). The protocol can be implemented in firmware on any microcontroller architecture as well as software on any computer software package (see list of client libraries below).

This implementation of the Firmata Procotol is designed to run on the Balena Fin's Co-processor, the Artik 020. This protocol implements supplementary methods to the standard Firmata Protocol, i.e. enabling powering down of the Balena Fin's Compute Module.
